  "articleBody": "Introduction Debugging, a.k.a. the process of finding and fixing errors in your code, is difficult. Even experienced programmers struggle to resolve bugs sometimes. Debugging is notoriously difficult for new programmers to learn.\nThis raises the question–what about debugging makes it so challenging for new programmers?\nDebugging requires:\ndisciplinary knowledge (e.g. knowing how to read code, understanding how a program executes, etc.) metacognitive practices (e.g. monitoring your understanding, help-seeking, reflecting on your understanding, etc.) complex problem solving skills (e.g. working systematically, hypothesizing about the error’s cause, etc.) With these challenges in mind, I set out to explore how we might design a tool that supports students during the debugging process. Specifically, I was interested in exploring how a tool that could prompt students from within the coding environment might be helpful.\nThink-Aloud Study In this study, I conducted think-aloud interviews with 14 students who had recently taken an introductory computer science course.\nI prepared a programming task for each participant to complete. My goal was to elicit debugging moments without making the task too difficult.\nDuring these interviews, I sat with participants and tested various low-fidelity prototypes. I frequently used a Wizard-of-Oz approach in which I would verbalize questions, ideas, or other information in an effort to prompt participants. This method allowed me to quickly get feedback on the content and type of support that participants responded to.\nInitial Findings The single biggest take-away from the think-aloud study was that no amount of metacognitive or problem solving support could overcome gaps in disciplinary knowledge.\nAdditionally, presenting paricipants with new ideas when they are already unsure or overwhelmed was not successful. This highlights the importance of developing real-time feedback systems that consider a user’s context and emotional state.\nNext Steps As a next step for in this work, I will be interviewing experienced Computer Science faculty to better understand their strategies and approaches to teaching debugging.\nThrough the results of the think-aloud study and related literature reviews, it became clear that there is a gap in the research around explicit debugging instruction and best practices. This interview study will help define the parameters for the next iteration of our debugging tool. This work is ongoing – more to come!\n",
