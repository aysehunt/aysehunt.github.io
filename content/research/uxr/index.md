## Introduction

In this project, I explored pain points and opportunities for a new dashboard experience. This work was part of my UX Research internship at Pampered Chef. 

The goal of the dashboard was to assist leaders in managing their team members and providing an overview of their team's sales progress. The aim of this project was to clarify leaders' top tasks and the information they need to accomplish their tasks. I also sought to understand how existing features supported leaders in managing their team.

## Part 1: Thematic analysis of open-ended feedback

One important source of data for this project was open-ended feedback that was generated during the annual Pampered Chef conference. At the conference, leaders and team members had the opportunity to provide feedback on digital experiences through sticky notes, conversations with members of the Tech team, and informal interviews. This was an opportunity for me to connect with users face-to-face, listen to what they had to say, and see their reactions to the current iteration of the team management page.

Following this event, I helped design and facilitate a workshop with stakeholders from Engineering, Product, and UX came together to analyze and discuss themes from the data. After the workshop, I supported further analysis and creation of materials to distribute more broadly to stakeholders throughout the company.

## Part 2: Discovery interviews

Building on some of the themes that emerged from the open-ended feedback, we decided to conduct a series of discovery interviews before moving to usability testing. The motivation to conduct more discovery was to capture and distill the practices of leaders who had demonstrated success in managing their teams. We were also aware that successful leaders had developed their own tools and ways organizing sales data to support their businesses, and our hope was to learn from those tools.


## Part 3: Statistically analyzing web analytics data

 To help explore the practices and feature use of successful leaders, I statistically analyzed website usage data. Through this analysis, I was able to find evidence that supported some of the insights that came up during discovery interviews. Additionaly, I highlighted a few features with lower usage.


## Conclusion

From this rich set of qualitative and quantitative data, I was able to present insights to stakeholders within the UX team to inform future design iterations of the new dashboard. Although it was not the primary objective of this project, this analysis also surfaced strategic insights related to a recent company-wide initiative.
